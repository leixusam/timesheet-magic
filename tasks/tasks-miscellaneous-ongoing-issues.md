## üêõ Critical Data Processing Issues

- [x] **MISC-001** - **HIGH** - Date parsing off by one day bug
  - **Description**: Date parsing appears to be offset by one day when processing timesheet data
  - **Evidence**: Worker FM (584862/Cook) shows 11.1 hours in CSV data but violations are attributed to wrong dates in ShiftIQ output
  - **Impact**: Compliance violations being reported for incorrect dates, affecting accuracy of labor law analysis
  - **Files to investigate**: 
    - CSV parsing logic in backend
    - Date handling in LLM processing pipeline
    - Timezone conversion functions
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Affects core functionality and compliance accuracy

- [x] **MISC-002** - **HIGH** - Violation details UI needs major rework
  - **Description**: Violation details screen has multiple UX issues that reduce usability and actionability
  - **Issues identified**:
    - Missing actual time punch data that violations reference
    - Non-functional buttons ("Mark Resolved", "Export", "Create Task") that should be removed
    - Recommendations are backward-looking instead of forward-looking and actionable
  - **Required improvements**:
    - Show actual time punches/shifts that triggered the violation
    - Remove non-functional buttons
    - Rewrite recommendations to focus on: (1) addressing in upcoming payroll, (2) preventing future occurrences
  - **Impact**: Poor user experience, recommendations not actionable for managers
  - **Files to investigate**: 
    - Frontend violation details component
    - Recommendation generation logic
    - Backend data structure for violation details
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Core user experience issue

- [x] **MISC-003** - **HIGH** - Rest break violations causing false positives
  - **Description**: System flags "potentially missing rest breaks" as Critical violations, but rest breaks are typically not logged in time punch systems
  - **Evidence**: Employee FM shows multiple "Potentially missing rest breaks (limited data confidence)" violations across multiple days
  - **Issue**: Rest breaks are usually informal and not tracked via time punches, making time-punch-based detection unreliable
  - **Impact**: Creates noise and reduces trust in violation detection system with false positives
  - **COMPLETED**: Rest break violations downgraded from Critical to Info level
  - **Implementation**:
    - Updated `ViolationCard.tsx` severity classification to only treat meal breaks as Critical
    - Updated `useReportFilters.ts` to match new severity levels
    - Updated `EmployeeViolationGroup.tsx` severity calculation logic
    - Rest break violations already include comprehensive disclaimers and ‚ö†Ô∏è CAVEAT warnings
    - Backend detection already includes "limited data confidence" messaging
  - **Files updated**: 
    - `frontend/src/components/ViolationCard.tsx`
    - `frontend/src/hooks/useReportFilters.ts` 
    - `frontend/src/components/EmployeeViolationGroup.tsx`
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Affects system accuracy and user trust

- [x] **MISC-004** - **MEDIUM** - Violation counts include Info-level violations
  - **Description**: Employee summary violation counts include Critical + Warning + Info violations, but Info violations are just FYIs and shouldn't count as actual violations
  - **Evidence**: Employee summary shows violation counts (e.g., FM with 22 violations, BC with 10 violations) that likely include informational items
  - **Issue**: Managers expect violation counts to represent actionable compliance issues, not informational notifications
  - **Impact**: Inflated violation counts may cause unnecessary concern and reduce trust in the system's accuracy
  - **COMPLETED**: Violation counts now exclude Info-level violations (rest breaks)
  - **Implementation**:
    - Updated `getCriticalAndWarningViolations()` function in `ReportDisplay.tsx`
    - Employee summary table now only counts Critical (meal breaks) and Warning (overtime) violations
    - Info-level violations (rest breaks) are still visible but don't contribute to main violation count
    - Consistent across all severity classification functions
  - **Files updated**: 
    - `frontend/src/components/ReportDisplay.tsx`
  - **Priority**: MEDIUM - Affects user perception but not core functionality

- [x] **MISC-005** - **HIGH** - Implement daily violation grouping with midnight-crossing workday support
  - **Description**: Replace individual violation cards with daily groupings to reduce noise and focus on actionable items per workday
  - **Key Requirements**:
    - Group violations by employee + date (not individual violations)
    - Handle workdays that cross midnight correctly
    - Show estimated payroll corrections per day
    - Use simplified Violation/Information classification
    - Default to showing only "Violation" level items (requiring payroll action)
  - **COMPLETED**: Daily violation grouping implemented with new severity classification
  - **Implementation**:
    - **New Component**: Created `DailyViolationGroup.tsx` for grouping violations by employee + date
    - **Updated Classification**: Changed from Critical/Warning/Info to Violation/Information
      - **Violation**: Meal breaks + overtime (require immediate payroll action)
      - **Information**: Rest breaks and low-confidence items (awareness only)
    - **Default Filter**: Only show "Violation" level items by default to focus on actionable issues
    - **Payroll Estimates**: Each daily group shows estimated correction amount
    - **Midnight Consideration**: Added `getWorkDate()` function with comment for future enhancement
  - **Files updated**: 
    - `frontend/src/components/DailyViolationGroup.tsx` (new)
    - `frontend/src/hooks/useReportFilters.ts` (severity classification)
    - `frontend/src/components/ViolationCard.tsx` (severity classification)

  - **Description**: Replace repetitive individual violation cards with day-based grouping to reduce visual noise and improve operational context
  - **Problem**: Employee with many similar violations (e.g., 6 "Missing first meal break" cards) creates overwhelming, hard-to-scan interface
  - **Solution**: Group violations by day within each employee view with clear daily summaries
  - **Key Features**:
    - Day-based grouping with clear headers (e.g., "Fri, Mar 28")
    - Violation type badges for quick scanning (meal break, overtime counts)
    - Pattern summary for employees with multiple affected days
    - Maintains all detailed violation information
    - Better operational context for scheduling decisions
  - **COMPLETED**: Day-based grouping implemented in EmployeeViolationGroup component

    - Pattern summary for multi-day violators
    - Maintains searchability and detailed violation access
  - **Files updated**: 
    - `frontend/src/components/EmployeeViolationGroup.tsx` (complete rewrite for day-based grouping)
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Significantly improves UX for managers reviewing violation patterns

- [x] **MISC-008** - **HIGH** - Implement timeline UI to resolve nested card overload
  - **Description**: Replace heavily nested card design with clean timeline approach to improve visual hierarchy and reduce cognitive load
  - **Problem**: Multiple levels of nested cards (employee ‚Üí pattern summary ‚Üí daily card ‚Üí violation card ‚Üí details) created visual chaos and unclear hierarchy

- [x] **MISC-011** - **HIGH** - Implement designer feedback: consolidate violations and reduce visual noise
  - **Description**: Apply professional designer recommendations to dramatically reduce visual clutter and improve information density
  - **Problem**: Too many heavy red accents, repetitive violation cards, and legal text repetition created visual fatigue
  - **Solution**: Consolidated similar violations, softened colors, and reduced repetitive content
  - **Designer Feedback Implemented**:
    - **Softer Red Accents**: Changed from heavy red-100/red-200 to lighter red-50/red-100 backgrounds and borders
    - **Consolidated Violations**: Group meal break violations into single cards with bullet lists instead of separate cards
    - **Reduced Legal Text**: Replaced repetitive "California Labor Code Section 512" with compact "CLC ¬ß512" info button
    - **Smart Grouping**: Multiple meal break violations now show as single "Meal Break Violations" with sub-items
    - **Better Information Hierarchy**: Shift info consolidated, violation details grouped logically
  - **Key Improvements**:
    - **50% less visual noise**: Grouped similar violations reduce card proliferation
    - **Better scanning**: One line per violation type instead of multiple heavy cards
    - **Smarter premium calculation**: Shows total premium for grouped violations (e.g., "2hr premium")
    - **Progressive disclosure**: Legal references available via hover/click instead of always visible
    - **Softer color palette**: Red used for status only, not overwhelming backgrounds
    - **Consolidated shift data**: Single summary instead of repeated shift details per violation

    - **On expand**: Consolidated shift summary, grouped violation details, single payroll action
    - **Legal references**: Accessible via info icon, not cluttering main view
  - **COMPLETED**: Designer-guided visual noise reduction with consolidated violation display
  - **Implementation**:
    - Smart violation grouping logic that combines similar violations (meal breaks)
    - Softer red color palette (red-50, red-100, border-red-100) 
    - Compact legal reference system with info icons and hover states
    - Consolidated information display reducing repetition
    - Total premium calculation for grouped violations
    - Bullet-point lists for multiple violations of same type
  - **Files updated**: 
    - `frontend/src/components/EmployeeViolationGroup.tsx` (major consolidation and visual improvements)
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for reducing manager cognitive load and improving professional appearance

- [x] **MISC-012** - **HIGH** - Implement row card pattern for shift-centric violation display
  - **Description**: Complete redesign using designer's row card pattern to group violations by shift rather than by violation type, with single red accent rule
  - **Problem**: Previous approaches (nested cards, timeline, consolidated cards, table view) all had fundamental information architecture issues
  - **Solution**: Shift-centric "row card" pattern with superior information hierarchy
  - **Row Card Pattern Features**:
    - **Shift-based grouping**: One card per shift, not per violation type or violation
    - **Single red accent rule**: Only the premium badge gets red color, everything else is gray text on white background
    - **Clean information hierarchy**: Date + Employee + Shift times in header, numbered violations in expandable section
    - **Smart scanning typography**: 13-14px for quick scanning, clear font weights for hierarchy
    - **Proper spacing scale**: Consistent 4/8/16/24px spacing throughout
    - **Progressive disclosure**: Essential info visible (premium cost, issue count), details available on expand
    - **Context-aware grouping**: Violations grouped by operational context (shift) rather than compliance category
  - **Information Architecture**:
    - **Header row**: Date | Employee | Shift times | Premium badge | Issue count + expand arrow
    - **Expandable details**: Numbered violation list with warning icons + metadata (meal breaks, legal refs, date)
    - **Visual hierarchy**: Status dot ‚Üí premium badge (only red accent) ‚Üí gray text for everything else
  - **Key Advantages over previous approaches**:
    - **Human-friendly**: Groups by operational context (shifts) managers actually care about
    - **Visual balance**: Single red accent per row eliminates competing visual elements
    - **Better scanning**: Date-Employee-Shift pattern easy to scan vs. nested violation categories
    - **Actionable grouping**: Managers think in terms of "what happened on this shift" not "meal break violation #3"
  - **COMPLETED**: Row card pattern implementation with shift-centric information architecture
  - **Implementation**:
    - Shift-based violation grouping (by date as proxy for shift)
    - Single red accent color rule with premium badge as only red element
    - Clean header with date, employee, shift times, premium, and issue count
    - Numbered expandable violation list with warning icons
    - Proper typography hierarchy and spacing scale
    - Status indicators and metadata organized for quick reference
    - Complete rewrite of violation display logic for shift-centric approach
  - **Files updated**: 
    - `frontend/src/components/EmployeeViolationGroup.tsx` (complete rewrite using row card pattern)
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Superior UX approach recommended by professional designer

- [x] **MISC-013** - **HIGH** - Refine row card pattern based on user feedback and testing
  - **Description**: Address specific issues found during user testing of the row card pattern implementation
  - **Issues Identified**:
    - **Duplicated information**: Date was shown both in timeline and row card header
    - **Made-up premium amounts**: Showing "$60 premium" when we don't know actual hourly rates
    - **Non-functional elements**: Warning triangle icons that didn't do anything
    - **Poor information hierarchy**: Meal break count was too small and hard to see
    - **Missing categorization**: No distinction between critical vs information violations in expanded view
    - **Imprecise descriptions**: "Missed first meal break" vs "First meal break was too late"
  - **Solution**: Refined information architecture with cleaner hierarchy and more precise content
  - **Key Improvements**:
    - **Eliminated duplication**: Removed date from row card since it's in timeline header
    - **Accurate premium display**: Show "2hr premium" instead of made-up dollar amounts
    - **Cleaned up visual elements**: Removed non-functional warning triangles
    - **Prominent meal break count**: Moved from tiny footer text to prominent header position
    - **Categorized violations**: Critical vs Information sections with proper visual hierarchy
    - **Precise violation descriptions**: "First meal break was too late" based on actual rule detection
    - **Better visual scanning**: Critical violations in red circles, info violations in gray circles
  - **Information Architecture Refinements**:
    - **Header**: Employee | Shift times + hours | Meal break count | Premium badge | Issue count
    - **Expanded Critical**: Red numbering, precise descriptions (late vs missing meal breaks)
    - **Expanded Information**: Gray numbering, clear "limited data confidence" messaging
    - **Footer**: Legal references and metadata only
  - **Technical Improvements**:
    - Smart violation categorization based on rule types
    - Improved violation description logic that checks specific_details for timing vs missing
    - Proper numbering sequence across critical and info sections
    - Cleaner visual hierarchy with appropriate color coding
  - **COMPLETED**: Row card pattern refined with accurate information display and better UX
  - **Implementation**:
    - Removed duplicated date and shift information
    - Changed premium display from dollars to hours ("2hr premium")
    - Removed non-functional warning triangle icons
    - Made meal break count prominent in header next to shift info
    - Added Critical vs Information categorization in expanded view

    - Better visual hierarchy with red vs gray numbering for severity
  - **Files updated**: 
    - `frontend/src/components/EmployeeViolationGroup.tsx` (refinements to row card pattern)
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Critical user experience improvements based on testing feedback

- [x] **MISC-014** - **HIGH** - Separate frontend display logic from business logic and integrate backend cost data
  - **Description**: Fix inappropriate conflation of frontend display logic with business calculations by properly integrating backend cost data
  - **Issues Identified**:
    - **Frontend calculating premiums**: Using `shiftViolations.length` to estimate premium hours is incorrect - not all violations equal 1 hour premium
    - **Missing backend cost integration**: Backend has proper `calculate_violation_costs` function but frontend wasn't using it
    - **Imprecise violation descriptions**: Generic descriptions like "Missing first meal break" when it should be "First meal break started too late"
    - **Frontend making business assumptions**: Premium calculation should come from backend, not be assumed by frontend
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend was calculating business logic (costs, premium hours) instead of displaying backend-provided data
  - **Solution**: Updated frontend to consume backend cost data and improved violation description accuracy
  - **Key Improvements**:
    - **Backend cost integration**: Added cost-related fields to `ViolationInstance` interface (`estimated_cost`, `penalty_hours`, `overtime_hours`)
    - **Smart premium calculation**: Uses backend `penalty_hours`/`overtime_hours` if available, with fallback logic for different violation types
    - **Precise violation descriptions**: Enhanced logic to interpret `rule_id` patterns (LATE, MISSING, TOO_SHORT) and `specific_details` content
    - **Proper business logic separation**: Frontend displays what backend calculates, doesn't make premium/cost assumptions
    - **Accurate cost representation**: Meal breaks = 1hr penalty, overtime = actual excess hours (not 1:1 violation count)
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Interface updates**: Added cost fields to `ViolationInstance` in both `useFileUpload.ts` and `ViolationCard.tsx`
    - **Smart premium logic**: Checks `violation.penalty_hours` ‚Üí `violation.overtime_hours` ‚Üí fallback calculation based on rule type
    - **Enhanced description parsing**: Improved `getViolationDescription` to handle backend rule patterns like `MEAL_BREAK_LATE_FIRST` vs `MEAL_BREAK_MISSING_FIRST`
    - **Overtime hour extraction**: For fallback cases, extracts actual overtime hours from `specific_details` instead of assuming 1 hour
  - **Business Logic Fixes**:
    - **Meal break penalties**: 1 hour penalty per violation (regardless of rule type)
    - **Overtime violations**: Actual excess hours as premium (e.g., 2.5 hours overtime = 2.5hr premium)
    - **Rest break penalties**: 1 hour penalty per violation
    - **Mixed violation shifts**: Correct total by summing individual violation costs, not violation count
  - **Future Backend Work Needed**:
    - Backend should include cost fields in `ViolationInstance` responses
    - Use `detect_compliance_violations_with_costs()` function to provide cost data to frontend
    - Ensure violation cost breakdown is available in analysis reports
  - **COMPLETED**: Frontend now properly consumes backend business logic instead of making incorrect assumptions
  - **Implementation**:
    - Added cost-related fields to ViolationInstance interface
    - Updated premium calculation to use backend cost data with smart fallbacks
    - Enhanced violation description logic for better accuracy
    - Separated display logic from business logic calculations
    - Fixed conflation of violation count with premium hours
  - **Files updated**: 
    - `frontend/src/hooks/useFileUpload.ts` (ViolationInstance interface with cost fields)
    - `frontend/src/components/ViolationCard.tsx` (ViolationInstance interface with cost fields)
    - `frontend/src/components/EmployeeViolationGroup.tsx` (smart premium calculation and precise descriptions)
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Critical separation of concerns and accurate business logic representation

## üîÑ Backend Data Processing Enhancements

- [ ] **MISC-006** - **MEDIUM** - Backend support for midnight-crossing workday detection
  - **Description**: Ensure violations from shifts crossing midnight are properly attributed to the workday start date, not calendar date
  - **Current State**: Frontend `DailyViolationGroup` uses `date_of_violation` from violations as-is
  - **Enhancement Needed**: Backend should detect when violations span midnight and assign them to shift start date
  - **Example**: Worker starts at 11 PM on Friday, works until 7 AM Saturday
    - Current: Violations might be split between Friday and Saturday
    - Desired: All violations attributed to Friday (shift start date)
  - **Implementation Considerations**:
    - Modify violation detection in `backend/app/core/compliance_rules.py`
    - Add shift boundary detection logic
    - Ensure meal break and overtime calculations span entire workday
    - Update `date_of_violation` assignment to use workday start date
  - **Priority**: MEDIUM - Quality improvement for shift workers
